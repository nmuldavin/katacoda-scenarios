## Introducing our Twitter stream

We have a twitter-like application where users can submit status updates in a stream.
You can view the sample event stream at: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

## Workshop goals

We would like to have a control panel in Datadog that allows us to take actions when needed. A simple action could be rate limiting calls to GET APIs, or blocking submission due to spam.
